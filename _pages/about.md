# üëã About me 

I am Yifan Liang, a graduate student pursuing M.S. in Intelligent Science and Technology at ![AIA](../assets/icons/aia.png){width="18" style="vertical-align:middle;"}School of Artificial Intelligence and Automation(AIA), ![HUST](../assets/icons/hust.png){width="18" style="vertical-align:middle;"}Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST). I graduated with honors from HUST in 2025, receiving the Outstanding Undergraduate Thesis Award and being recognized as an Honored Graduate.

My research interests focus on computer vision and machine learning, particularly in vision-language models(VLMs) and out-of-distribution(OOD) detection. I am passionate about developing robust AI systems that can handle real-world challenges and uncertainties.

I have published research at top-tier AI conferences, including a **Highlight paper** at CVPR 2025 (top 2.98%), which addresses the shortcut problem in VLMs for robust OOD detection. I was also awarded the National First Prize in the 18th "Challenge Cup" National College Student Extracurricular Academic and Technological Works Competition.
